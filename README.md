Have you ever been flying over the beautiful blue ocean looking for a weak and pathetic child with a churro to steal, and suddnley as you beigin to dive you are filled with a deep sense of lonleyness? Has this sense of lonleyness dibilitated you in every aspect of your live - driving you to a point of desperation so severe that you turn to online dating? Then Seagullr is for you!
